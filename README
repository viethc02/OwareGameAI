Welcome to the Oware game!

we will develop an agent to play the Oware game.

The rules of the game are described here:
    * https://www.yourturnmyturn.com/rules/oware.php
    * The game also ends when it exceeds 240 turns. In this case, the winner is
      the player with the most seeds. It means the condition for the
      "endless cycle of moves" described in the rules is not valid in this
      tournament.
    * In addition to the above rules, we consider a time limit (e.g., 5 seconds)
      for each turn. As it would be difficult to adjust to any given time-bound,
      each player can generate a sequence of increasing good actions in each
      turn, and the last action within the time limit will be considered as the
      chosen action for that turn.
      If a player does not choose any action within the time limit or it
      chooses an invalid move, a random action will be selected for the
      player.


Requirements
